# Differences between arrow and normal function 
Arrow functions don't have their own this or arguments binding.  Instead, these(this or arguments) identifiers are resolved in the nearest lexical scope like any other variable.

# Differences between foreach, for..in and for..of (ES6)

* for..in loops over enumerable property names of an object / operates on any object. it serves as a way to inspect properties on this object.
* for..of (new in ES6) does use an object-specific iterator and loops over the values generated by that.
* for..in returns a list of keys on the object being iterated
* for..of returns a list of values of the numeric properties of the object being iterated.

in >> iterates over Array Index/Object Keys ; iterates Object, Array
of >> iterates over Array values ; iterates Array Only
foreach >> iterates over Array keys, values ; iterates Array Only

# Constant in ES 6
* Constants are used to make variables which cannot be re-assigned new value. "const" keyword makes variable itself immutable, not its assigned content (for instance, in case the content is an object, this means the object itself can still be altered).
* Variables defined with const are not hoisted to the top.
* Both Const and Let are block scoped.
