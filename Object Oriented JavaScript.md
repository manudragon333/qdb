# What is a constructor function.

JavaScript uses special functions called constructor functions to define and initialize objects and their (prototype) properties.

# Define Encapsulation, NameSpace, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, ?

# Factory Functions in JavaScript?

# Find prototype of object
```
Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);
obj.prototype;


```
