# What is a constructor function.

JavaScript uses special functions called constructor functions to define and initialize objects and their (prototype) properties.

# Define Encapsulation, NameSpace, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, ?

# Factory Functions in JavaScript?

# Find prototype of object
```
Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);
obj.prototype;


```

# Find constructor of object
```
obj.constructor; // OR : obj.constructor.name;
obj instanceof ConstructorFunctionName
```

The `instanceof` operator tests whether the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object.
